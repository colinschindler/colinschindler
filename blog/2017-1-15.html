          <p>Michelle and I have really fallen in love with Phoenix. We knew the weather would be awesome but expected a flat, barren desert. Turns out there are mountains scattered throughout the city for hiking and mountain biking, national parks in all directions to escape the city, and all the good food, events, music that comes with a city. Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and the Grand Canyon are also within a reasonable driving range. But the people have been the best feature. They are so nice, and sincerely so. Our first day here we were invited to two dinners walking through downtown. We met Jacque at one of Michelle's shows and she lead us on a bike tour the following day. Such cool people.</p>

          <p>But the coolest people have been Sky & Regina King. They welcomed us to park the van in their backyard and have shown us Phoenix from a local's perspective. We also got to try yoga for the first time with Regina, which was much cooler than I expected, and have already gone again since then.</p>

          <p>We also got to meet up with Aunt Kathy and Bob for lunch and a discussion on politics, which was pretty funny as always. Later on we picked up Katrina and made the trip south to meet Sky's father Bob and Margaret. Katrina had an awesome wedding video of Tami and Bret McClanahan from 1986 that included my mother when she was pregnant with me. So crazy to see all my aunts and uncles when they were younger than I am now. And also makes for good snapchats to tease everyone with, haha.</p>

          <p>Michelle played her first Phoenix show at the Lost Leaf in downtown Phoenix. A few beers with Sky and Regina there led us to some fried green tomato sandwiches and donuts with "extra" powdered sugar on top.</p>

          <p>At her show Michelle met Jacque Orr (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jacqueorr1/">@jacqueorr1</a>) who led us on a bike ride the next day. We went on a ride along the Salt river near Tempe starting at Papago Park.</p>

          <p>The following day Sky took us on a hike up Camelback Moutain which juts up from Phoenix and gives a nice view of the urban surroundings. Interestingly, the smog from the city shrouds the surrounding mountains which is kind of beautiful, in a toxic kind of way I guess.</p>
