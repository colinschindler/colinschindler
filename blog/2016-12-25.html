          <p>We had a blast in Colorado. We got to hang out with some cool people, try a few new things, and get to know a few more places. Denver in particular I like a little more. <a target="_blank" href="http://voodoodoughnut.com/"> Voodoo Doughtnuts</a> stand out, Cherry Creek park was a natural surprise we didn't expect in the big city.</p>

          <p>Michelle played her final Colorado show at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mccarthysaurora.com/">McCarthy's Sports Bar and Grill</a> and we set south the very next day.</p>

          <p>We swung through Colorado Springs on Christmas morning and checked out the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_the_Gods">Garden of the Gods</a>. Surprisngly, there were a ton of people there, mostly foreign, but it was still cool, ha.

          <p>On leaving the park we made a last minute decision to cut West into the mountains and head south through the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Valley">San Luis Valley</a>. I'm glad we did this as it introduced me to a part of Colorado I was unaware of; a flat, high desert surrounded by mountains. Before night fell we wandered into <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sand_Dunes_National_Park_and_Preserve">Great Sand Dunes National Park</a> and raced the sunset scrambling towards what we discovered later to be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.summitpost.org/high-dune/249915">High Dune</a>. I really enjoyed these dunes and expected them to be much smaller. They are really, really big sand dunes.</p>

          <p>It felt pretty good struggling up the mix of sand and snow and getting there just as the sun was hitting the horizon. The temps noticably started to chill in the newly arrived dusk as I started to lumber back down the duneside. I paused to watch a lone distant figure with a giant backpack. He was stopped, presumably gazing around, about halfway towards a still far away, much larger dune deeper into the sands. After a brief moment he turned and resumed his slow pace up the dunes. What an interesting site I thought this. Christmas day, all alone, stoically walking up and into very large sand dunes in the now dark. I assume he was going to spend the night camping in the dunes. It got to -8 degrees that night. What a legend...</p>

          <p>Now that this crazy dude kind of took the wind from my sails, I headed back towards the van. Some people can be really impressive, and I'm glad when I see them. That night our heater failed to start as we were 3000 feet higher than the fuel pump was rated for. We ate some Christmas pasta with ghost pepper hot sauce, put on all our layers of cold weather gear and went to bed. It got cold, that guy out in the dunes, Jesus...</p>
