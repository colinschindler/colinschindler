        <h1>Tonight I Can Write</h1><br /><br />
        <p>
          Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br /><br />
        Write, for example, "The night is starry<br />
          and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance."<br /><br />
        The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br /><br />
        Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br />
          I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br /><br />
        Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.<br />
          I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br /><br />
        She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.<br />
          How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br /><br />
        Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br />
          To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.<br /><br />
        To hear the immense night, still more immese without her.<br />
          And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br /><br />
        What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br />
          The night is starry and she is not with me.<br /><br />
        This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br />
          My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br /><br />
        My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br />
          My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br /><br />
        The same night whitening the same trees.<br />
          We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br /><br />
        I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br />
          Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br /><br />
        Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br />
          my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br /><br />
        Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br />
          and these the last verses that I write for her.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>When the Tao is present in the universe, <br />
        The horses haul manure. <br />
        When the Tao is absent from the universe, <br />
        War horses are bred outside the city. <br /><br />
        There is no greater sin than craving, <br />
        No greater misfortune than wanting something for ourselves. <br />
          Therefore those who know that enough is enough will always have enough.</p>
