<p>Meditate often on the interconnectedness and mutual interdependence of all things in the universe. For in a sense, all things are mutually woven together and therefore have an affinity for each other--for one things follows after another according to their tension of movement, their sympathetic stirrings, and the unity of all substance.</p>
  <em>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.38</em><br /><br />
