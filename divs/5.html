<p>When the Tao is present in the universe, <br />
  The horses haul manure. <br />
  When the Tao is absent from the universe, <br />
  War horses are bred outside the city. <br /><br />
  There is no greater sin than craving, <br />
  No greater misfortune than wanting something for ourselves. <br />
  Therefore those who know that enough is enough will always have enough.</p>
