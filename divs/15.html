<p>My words are easy to understand and easy to perform, <br />
  Yet no one under heaven knows them or practices them. <br /><br />
  My words have ancient beginnings.<br />
  My actions are disciplined.<br />
  Because people do not understand, they have no knowledge of me.<br /><br />
  Those that know me are few;<br />
  Those that abuse me are honored.<br />
  Therefore the wise wear rough clothing and hold the jewel in their heart.</p>
  <em>Tao Te Ching, 70</em><br />
