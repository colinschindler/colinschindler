<h1>Tonight I Can Write</h1><br /><br />
<p>
  Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br /><br />
  Write, for example, "The night is starry<br />
  and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance."<br /><br />
  The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br /><br />
  Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br />
  I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br /><br />
  Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.<br />
  I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br /><br />
  She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.<br />
  How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br /><br />
  Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br />
  To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.<br /><br />
  To hear the immense night, still more immese without her.<br />
  And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br /><br />
  What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br />
  The night is starry and she is not with me.<br /><br />
  This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br />
  My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br /><br />
  My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br />
  My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br /><br />
  The same night whitening the same trees.<br />
  We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br /><br />
  I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br />
  Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br /><br />
  Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br />
  my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br /><br />
  Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br />
  and these the last verses that I write for her.<br /><br /></p>
