Charleston Cyclists 
- figure out how to make images load faster. Might require site wide lazy loading.

priorities
- create a paypal button for the new charleston prints
- create a signed copy, and proper sizing, for Charleston shots

simple
- print-info: make it look nicer, more compelling
- make purchase call to actions more attention getters
- update seo info
- fix the big dipper blacked out shitty-looking area
- create more interesting descriptions for all shots, be a poet
- create a bunch of different colin headshot and make a 
  js function to randomly select on on load
- in sw blog, add the og img as a background for each post rather than just text

hard
- add the state icon where us landscape photo was taken 
- make clicking prints enlarge them to fullscreen
- lazy load (intersection observer api) all offscreen images
  - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video/
- go through and delete/make css better

eventually 
-update SEO when you know what you're doing

completed
